// CODING EXERCISE
// You're in the market for a new car but want it to be electric. 
// Create an instance of the Car class called model3. 
// The year must be a number (so don't wrap it in quotation marks). 
// Set the brand to "Tesla" and change the poweredBy to "electricity".

class Car {
	constructor({ year, brand, poweredBy = 'gas' }) {
		this.year = year;
		this.brand = brand;
		this.poweredBy = poweredBy;
	}

	carSpecs() {
		return(`The ${this.year} ${this.brand} runs on ${this.poweredBy}`)
	}
}

//Write your code here

const model13 = new constructor({year: 2018, brand: "tesla", poweredBy: "electricity"})
model13.carspecs

```class Car {
    constructor({ year, brand, poweredBy = 'gas' }) {
        this.year = year;
        this.brand = brand;
        this.poweredBy = poweredBy;
    }

    carSpecs() {
        return(`The ${this.year} ${this.brand} runs on ${this.poweredBy}`)
    }
}

//Write your code here

const model13 = new Car({year: 2018, brand: "tesla", poweredBy: "electricity"})
model13.carSpecs()```

You werenâ€™t instantiating your class properly

`const model13 = new constructor` should be `const model13 = new Car`
